It wouldn't be new or original of me to say that poetry has changed in recent years. Poetry come to be seen as capital "P" Poetry, an institution surrounded by walls of pretention and inaccessible knowledge. But poetry has no fixed address; it doesn't (and shouldn't) belong to a particular voice or face or place. To say so would erase the unquantifiable amount of shapes that the genre has taken over the years. Whilst collections of poetry, by the likes of Rupi Kaur and Amanda Lovelace have become one of the most accessible literary art forms, rippling accross the worlds of social media and publishing. 

Narrative poetry has been on a different journey, having been recently re-invigorated by the YA genre.  Nursery rhymes and children's poetry have obviously been a big part of culture for a long time, but poetry for teenagers? Though unsurprising, it's still exciting and somewhat revolutionary. Modern poets of the YA genre are bridging the gap between the point we loose our love of poetry and the time we gain all of our weighty assumptions about who and what it's for. Narrative poetry has specifically been used by authors such as Kwame Alexander and Elizabeth Acevedo to explore YA themes of identity, family and relationships. 

> "You are a full human being. It's never as simple as being half and half.” 

Dean Atta does the same in his brilliant coming-of-age novel *The Black Flamingo*, which follows Michael through secondary school and his first year of university. We walk with Michael through realisations about his sexuality, his experiences of searching for a father-figure, and making his debut into the drag world. 

> “This book is a fairy tale  in which I am the prince  and the princess. I am  the king and the queen.  I am my own wicked  witch and fairy godmother.  This book is a fairy tale  in which I’m cursed  and blessed by others.  But, finally, I am the fair y  finding my own magic.”

This form of narrative poetry allows Atta to break narrative conventions, creating a story that authentically portrays the ups and downs of finding yourself. His protagonist wrestles with multiple internal relationships; to sexuality,gender and to race. What we come to realise is these are not separate identities, but part of the network that makes up Michael. By the end, the story doesn't feel like it's over, and his journey through identity, realistically, still has a long way to go.

Atta will undoubtedly continue to grow as an important voice in the YA genre as his verse flows powerfully, and his stories are both heartwarming and thought-provoking. With another potential YA hit in the pipeline, I'd recommend keeping an eye on this incredibly talented author for the forseeable future, and go pick up a copy of The Black Flamingo as soon as possible! 5/5 Stars.
